Cacheing bug: Opera caches the edit page and shows old source code with new
changes lost.

If you upload an image and then hit reload, the server hangs. This is a known
bug. It is mentioned here: http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/FileUpload . A test is
also suggested there. Not clear what to do about it, though.

Reloading and deleting images.

Move ~/python/nifki to ~/srv/nifki and fix the various "makeJar" 
scripts.
